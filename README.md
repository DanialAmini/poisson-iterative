# Navier-stokes-2D-numerical-solve-with-custom-scenarios-MATLAB-
 I have created this repository to share my code for 2D numerical solving of Navier stokes equations (incompressible flow); although it will take a little time for me to completely update the repository.<br />
 
 This repository is related to a video on my youtube channel which shows example outputs from my code;<br />

So far aiming to have the code uploaded by 15/01/2018.
[7/01/2018] <br />
I am still tidying up the code for upload to github(amongst doing other things), it has definitely taken much longer (in time) to tidy up the code than I thought it would take. <br />

Mainly, because I had not looked at the code in over a year (prior to 30/12/2017) for which I also am double checking and optimising used algorithms. <br />

At this stage, I think I should have the code uploaded by during next week; I will post an update during middle of next week.<br />

I am currently in the process of tidying up my matlab and will have it uploaded soon.<br />
