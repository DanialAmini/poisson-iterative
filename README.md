# Navier-stokes-2D-numerical-solve-with-custom-scenarios-MATLAB-
 I have created this repository to share my code for 2D numerical solving of Navier stokes equations (incompressible flow); although it will take a little time for me to completely update the repository
 
 This repository is related to a video on my youtube channel which shows example outputs from my code;
